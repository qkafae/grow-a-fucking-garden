# Grow A Fucking Garden 🌱
> This project is not yet complete !!!! Estiimated alpha release idk

This is Grow A Garden (concept), but made more casual, and into a CLI (Command Line Interface)
I've implemented a lot of new things:
- plants (duh)
- mastery
- shop w/ rotation
- very chill game

# Supported Devices 💻
- OS: *MacOS High Sierra*, Windows 8.1 or later
- Disk: Minimum 256mb of disk space
- CPU: Any

> MacOS support is extremely limited and may not work as intended, but it should work so idk

# Installation ☁️
### 1. 
Download installer from [releases](https://github.com/qkafae/grow-a-fucking-garden/releases)
- `gafg-installer-vx.x.x-win.exe` for windows
- `gafg-installer-vx.x.x-mac.app` for mac

> I'll attemp to get it added to homebrew/chocolately for an easier installation process, but for now its just another cli installer

### 2.
Run the installer

### 3.
After installation, go to any terminal of your choice and type `gafg --quickstart` to initialize the app (you will need to do this after any updates.

# Side notes ⚠️
And there you have it, Grow A Fucking Garden fully installed, here are some other stuff you should know:
- run `gafg --help` for the list of commands
- we **do not** recommend disabling caching as it would slow down overall performance
- enjoy <3
