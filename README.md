> This project is not yet complete !!!!

> To see how the development of this is going, see Development at the bottom

This is Grow A Garden (concept), but made more casual, and into a CLI (Command Line Interface)
Anyways here's some cool stuff yay:
- plants (duh)
- expandable garden (duh)
- daily rotational shop
- mastery (to unlock new plants)
- very chill game with no brainrot

It's extremely easy to cheat in this game (everything is saved locally) but whats the point of doing it, so just enjoy the game and play it as is

# Supported Devices 💻
- OS: *MacOS High Sierra*, Windows 8.1 or later
- Disk: Minimum 256mb of disk space
- CPU: Any

> MacOS support is extremely limited and may not work as intended, but it should work so idk

# Side notes ⚠️
Here are some other stuff you should know:
